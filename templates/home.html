                        <p><a href="https://www.donorschoose.org/about">DonorsChoose.org</a> is a US based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate money directly to public school classroom projects. Public school teachers post classroom project requests on the platform, and individuals have the option to donate money directly to fund these projects. The classroom projects range from pencils and books to computers and other expensive equipments for classrooms. In more than 10 years of existence, this platform helped teachers in all US states to post more than 7700,000 classroom project requests and raise more than $280,000,000. DonorsChoose.org has made the platform data open and available for making discoveries and building applications.</p>

                        <p>In this project we will be using one of the available datasets for building an interactive data visualization that represents school donations broken down by different attributes.</p>
